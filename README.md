## How to Install and Run a Project

1. Make sure you are in the root folder for the project eg. `cd complete-guide`
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Run the project on localhost `npm start`

## Creating a new React App

To create a new react project:

`create-react-app app-name-here`

Note: this will crete a new folder called `app-name-here` in the current directory.
